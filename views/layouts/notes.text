//put in fs handlebars

this was a muilti page app. But it makes more sense to do it as a single page card app and link to my person site. But this is a great start for showing how to pull items from DB's


<br>
<br>
<!--will print out [object Object]-->
{{term}}
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--this will print out JSON and step throw all of the return-->
<div> foo from object</div>
{{#each term}}
	{{@key}} | {{this}}
{{/each}}
<br>
